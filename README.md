# Python / SQLite / SQLAlchemy / TKinter Example

Repository is a template structure for building a tkinter app using a connection to SQLite and an SQLAlchemy ORM

- Version 1.0 - template only - view in the template branch

- Version 1.1 - Starting to build the database application

- Version 1.2 - CLI and GUI interfaces now available

Start the application by running start_app.py. To change from GUI mode to CLI mode change the interface variable in start_app.py to "cli"

The file structures in this example was heavily influence by the [Tk and SQLAlchemy Tutorial](https://heavymetalcoding.com/2020/03/11/django-orm-and-sqlalchemy-a-comparison-using-tkinter/) in [Heavy Metal Coding Blog](https://heavymetalcoding.com/)
